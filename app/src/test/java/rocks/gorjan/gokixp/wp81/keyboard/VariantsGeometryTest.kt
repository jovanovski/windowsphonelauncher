 * Checked as arithmetic for the reason [AlternatesGeometryTest] gives: every way this goes
 * wrong is a block that still looks like a block - a few pixels off the screen, or one whose
 * first cell is not the emoji the finger is on, which turns a hold into a lucky dip. The
 * numbers are the real ones: a 1344 pixel panel at eight emoji across, which is the phone
 * this was built on, and the two family sizes the asset actually has - six, which nearly
 * every family is, and twenty-six, which the thirteen two-person emoji are.
