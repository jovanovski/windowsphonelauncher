/**
 * How the joystick walks the caret.
 *
 * This is a *feel* being tested, which is unusual and is the reason it is worth doing. Every
 * way this goes wrong looks fine on screen - a caret that runs a little too fast, a nudge that
 * does nothing about half the time, a stick that banks movement while it is against the end of
 * the text and then lurches - and none of those can be found by reading the code or by holding
 * a thumb on a phone and guessing. Asked as arithmetic they are all one assertion each.
 *
 * A frame is stepped explicitly rather than waited for, so these run in microseconds and the
 * one property that actually matters at sixty frames a second - that the caret's speed does
 * not depend on how often it is asked - can be checked by asking it at two different rates.
