 * it. These two say "this is the one that starts the call", each of them next to a button
 * an inch away that does the opposite - ends it, or saves the number instead - and green
 * has meant this on a telephone for longer than any of this has existed. A phone whose
 * accent happened to be red would otherwise put a red button under "answer".
