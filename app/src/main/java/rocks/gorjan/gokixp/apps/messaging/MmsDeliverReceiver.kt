/**
 * A picture message arriving, which this app does not do - said out loud.
 *
 * It has to exist. An app is only offered the messaging role if it declares a receiver for
 * this, alongside the one for text messages, an activity that answers `SENDTO` and a
 * service that answers `RESPOND_VIA_MESSAGE`; three of those four do real work and this is
 * the fourth. Without it Messaging cannot be the phone's messaging app at all.
 *
 * What arrives here is not the picture. It is a push saying one is waiting on the network,
 * and fetching it means decoding a binary PDU, opening a connection on the carrier's own
 * APN and reassembling the parts - a protocol, not a feature, and one this app has
 * deliberately not taken on.
 *
 * So the message is not shown, and the notice says so. That is the point of this class:
 * the push is delivered to one app and consumed, so a picture message that arrived while
 * Messaging held the role is a picture message nobody else will ever show either. Silence
 * would make that look like nothing had happened - somebody sent something, and the phone
 * would simply never mention it. This at least tells the reader there is something they
 * are not seeing, and who to ask about it.
 *
 * Group messages are the common case, because most carriers carry a text to several people
 * as a multimedia message.
