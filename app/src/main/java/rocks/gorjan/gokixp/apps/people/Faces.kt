 * on a worker thread with a few moments to live, and they want the bitmap now.
 *
 * Sized down to what a notification actually shows. The stored picture is a camera
 * photograph and it has to cross a Binder transaction to reach the shade, which is a
 * limit measured in kilobytes rather than megapixels.

 *
 * Without an icon on the [androidx.core.app.Person], the platform draws its own default
 * avatar - a grey circle - and then badges the notification's small icon into the corner
 * of it, so a text from a number with no photo arrives as a large nothing with a tiny
 * speech bubble stuck to it. The mark is the only part of that which says anything, so it
 * is drawn as the whole avatar instead.
 *
 * White on the accent, which is what [rocks.gorjan.gokixp.wp81.metroLook] makes of a small
 * icon anyway - the large one then reads as the same mark, larger, rather than as a second
 * unrelated thing. The [glyph] is expected to be a white silhouette; the accent is the
 * background it sits on.
 *
 * Sized and inset for [androidx.core.graphics.drawable.IconCompat.createWithAdaptiveBitmap],
 * which is how the callers pass a face: an adaptive bitmap shows only its middle two
 * thirds, so the colour has to reach the edges and the mark has to stay well inside them.
