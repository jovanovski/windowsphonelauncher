 * goes out through the same [MessageStore.send] a message typed in the app does, so a
 * reply from the shade is written into the conversation exactly like any other.
 *
 * Not exported. Nothing outside this app has any business sending messages as it.

     * whole of this method: a broadcast has about ten seconds to finish, a message can take
     * longer than that to be acknowledged, and waiting for the acknowledgement meant the
     * launcher stopped answering. Which, on a phone whose home screen this is, looks
     * exactly like the phone itself dying - and did.
     *
     * The answer still arrives; it is simply not what the broadcast waits on. If the
     * message did not go, that is said afterwards in a notification of its own, which is
     * the right place for it anyway - the shade is where this conversation is happening.
