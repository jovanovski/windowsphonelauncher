/**
 * Markdown, drawn on a note as it is written.
 *
 * The note stays plain text - it is the desktop Notepad's note, and that one has never
 * heard of markdown - so nothing here changes a character of it. What changes is how it is
 * set: a heading is set large, a starred word bold, a hyphen at the head of a line is drawn
 * as a bullet and a `- [ ]` as a box to tick.
 *
 * The marks go once they have done their work, the way they do in Notion: type `**bold**`
 * and the stars disappear as the caret moves on. They are still in the note, taking no room,
 * and each one comes back while the caret is at it - so a mark can be seen before it is
 * deleted, and the caret never sits beside something it cannot see. A note that is only
 * being read, with no caret in it, shows none of them.
 *
 * Restyled after every change and every move of the caret rather than parsed once: a note
 * is short, and a styler that only looked at the line being typed would miss a code fence
 * opened ten lines up.
