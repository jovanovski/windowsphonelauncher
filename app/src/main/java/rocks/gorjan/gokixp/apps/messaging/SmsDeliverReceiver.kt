/**
 * A text message arriving, handed to this app because it is the phone's messaging app.
 *
 * `SMS_DELIVER` goes to exactly one app on the device and carries the whole job with it:
 * the platform does not write the message down, does not announce it, and does not keep a
 * copy. Whatever this receiver fails to do is a message that never existed. That is the
 * entire weight of the messaging role, and it is why the write comes first and everything
 * else after it.
 *
 * Not to be confused with `SMS_RECEIVED`, which every app with the permission gets and
 * which none of them may act on. This one is ours alone, and only while the role is held -
 * the system stops sending it the moment another app takes over, which is the whole
 * mechanism by which two messaging apps never both write the same message down.
