/**
 * The missed call, told to the phone app rather than posted over its head.
 *
 * Telecom will hand a missed call to whichever app is the phone - but only if that app
 * says it wants one, and the way it says so is by having a receiver for this action in its
 * manifest. Without one Telecom posts a notification of its own instead, which is what was
 * happening here: a notification saying "Missed call" twice over, opening whichever other
 * app on the device claims `vnd.android.cursor.dir/calls`. Which was the AOSP dialler, so
 * tapping the launcher's missed call opened somebody else's phone app.
 *
 * The declaration in the manifest is therefore not decoration - it is the whole mechanism.
 * Telecom checks for it, finds it, and stops posting; from then on the notification is
 * ours, which means it can say who rang and open the page that has their call on it.
