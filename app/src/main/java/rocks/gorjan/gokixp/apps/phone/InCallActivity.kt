/**
 * The window a call happens in.
 *
 * An activity of its own rather than a page inside the launcher, for one reason: most
 * calls arrive when the launcher is not what you are looking at. The phone may be locked,
 * face down, or showing somebody else's app, and only an activity can be put in front of
 * all three - see [android.app.Activity.setShowWhenLocked], which is how a call screen has
 * been allowed over a lock screen since Android 8.
 *
 * It holds nothing. [CallScreen] reads [CallCentre] directly, so this is a frame around
 * that and a set of window flags, and it goes away the moment there is no call left.
