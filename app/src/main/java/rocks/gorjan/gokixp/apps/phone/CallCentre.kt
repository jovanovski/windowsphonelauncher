/**
 * The calls going on right now.
 *
 * Android hands a phone app its calls through an [InCallService], which the system binds
 * and unbinds as it pleases and which is emphatically not a place to keep a screen. So the
 * service puts what it is given here, the screen reads it from here, and neither has to
 * know whether the other exists - which matters, because they genuinely come and go
 * independently: a call can arrive before there is a screen, and a screen can be rotated
 * out from under a call.
 *
 * A singleton for the same reason the telephone in a hallway was: there is one of it. Two
 * views of the calls in progress that could disagree would be a bug with no upside.
