/**
 * The wall of favourites, and the drag that arranges it.
 *
 * A grid of squares that can be picked up and put down somewhere else, which is the one
 * gesture Windows Phone's Start screen taught everybody who used it: hold, carry, drop.
 * The tiles under the one being carried get out of its way as it passes rather than
 * waiting for it to land, so the arrangement you are looking at while you drag is the
 * arrangement you will get.
 *
 * The order it produces is the app's to keep. Android's address book has no notion of one
 * - a contact is starred or it is not - so a wall arranged here is a fact about this app
 * and nowhere else, and [onReordered] hands back the keys in their new order for the app
 * to write down.
 *
 * Hold and release without moving and it is not a drag at all: that is [Tile.onHeld], the
 * long press, which is where the commands for a tile live. One gesture with two endings,
 * told apart by whether the finger went anywhere - which is how a phone that has no room
 * for a right mouse button gets both.
