/**
 * A message, in the shade, as the person who sent it.
 *
 * This exists because of the role. While another app is the phone's messaging app, that
 * app announces arriving messages and there is nothing for the launcher to do; the moment
 * this launcher takes the role, that app is not told a message arrived at all - so a text that is
 * not announced here is a text nobody ever finds out about. It is the other half of
 * [MessageStore.writeIncoming], and just as non-optional.
 *
 * Built as a conversation - a [NotificationCompat.MessagingStyle] against a [Person], with
 * a long-lived shortcut behind it - which is the one arrangement that puts somebody's face
 * where an app's icon would otherwise be, and the same one the missed call uses. See
 * [MissedCallReceiver] for the longer note on why a plain notification with a large icon is
 * not the same thing.
 *
 * One notification per conversation, replaced rather than stacked, carrying the last few
 * messages: two texts from the same person are one conversation with two lines in it, and
 * two entries in the shade for one conversation is a shade that has to be cleared twice.
