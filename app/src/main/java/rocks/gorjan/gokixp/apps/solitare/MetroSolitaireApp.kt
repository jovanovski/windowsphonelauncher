/**
 * Solitaire, as the phone would have had it.
 *
 * Klondike is Klondike - the same seven piles, the same four homes, the same deck the
 * desktop version deals from and the same card faces on it, down to the back you picked in
 * that one. What changes is everything around them. The green baize goes, because it was a
 * picture of a card table drawn for a screen pretending to be a desk; the board is the
 * page's own colour, the empty places are outlines in it, and the two numbers that say how
 * the game is going are set above the board in the accent, in the same hand as the rest of
 * the shell.
 *
 * Cards are dragged, as cards are. A tap is the shortcut rather than the whole of the
 * input: it sends a card wherever it can go, home first, which is what a tap on a card
 * nearly always means. Both are on the same touch - what tells them apart is whether the
 * finger travelled - so nobody has to know which one this game wanted.
