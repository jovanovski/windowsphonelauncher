/**
 * What turns a saved alarm into a phone that actually goes off.
 *
 * Everything here goes through [AlarmManager.setAlarmClock], which is not one exact-alarm
 * API among several - it is the one Android means by "an alarm clock". It is exempt from
 * Doze and from app standby, it is the only kind the system will not batch or slide, and
 * it is what puts the little clock in the status bar and fills in "next alarm" on the lock
 * screen. An alarm app that used `setExact` would be an app whose alarms the system is
 * entitled to defer while the phone is asleep, which is the one condition every alarm is
 * set for.
 *
 * One pending intent per alarm, keyed by its id. A snooze is not a second alarm - it is
 * the same alarm due sooner - so [nextTrigger] simply answers with whichever of the two
 * comes first and there is only ever one thing scheduled per row in the list.
 *
 * [sync] is the only way anything is scheduled: it takes down everything it put up last
 * time and puts up what the store says now. That makes the store the single account of
 * what the phone is going to do, and makes a stale alarm - one deleted while its intent
 * was still pending - impossible rather than merely unlikely. The ids it has outstanding
 * are written down for the same reason: after a reboot or an update, this process has no
 * memory of what the last one scheduled.
