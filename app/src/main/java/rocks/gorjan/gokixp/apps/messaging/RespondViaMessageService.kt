/**
 * "Can't talk now" - the message a ringing phone offers to send instead of answering.
 *
 * Declaring this is one of the four things an app must do to be offered the messaging
 * role, and unlike the picture-message receiver it does real work: when any dialler on the
 * phone declines a call with a message, Telecom hands the words to whichever app is the
 * messaging app and that app sends them.
 *
 * Which closes a loop this shell already had. The quick replies on the incoming call
 * screen decline with [android.telecom.Call.reject] and a line of text, and Telecom
 * carries that here - so with both roles held, People asks itself to send its own reply,
 * and the message lands in the conversation with that person like any other.
