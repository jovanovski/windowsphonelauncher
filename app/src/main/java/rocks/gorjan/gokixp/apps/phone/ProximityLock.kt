/**
 * The screen off while something is close to it.

 * The platform's own proximity wake lock, in one place. What it does is turn the *display*
 * off, which takes the touchscreen with it - reading the sensor by hand could only black
 * the picture out and would leave a screen still listening, and a cheek on a live
 * touchscreen is how a call ends up on hold, on speaker, or hung up.
 *
 * Held by [GokiInCallService] for the length of a call against somebody's ear, and by the
 * test command in [PhoneApp] for a minute at a time. Both go through here so the thing
 * being tested is the thing that runs during a call, rather than a second implementation
 * that happens to look like it.
 *
 * A process-wide single lock, because there is only one screen. Asking for it twice is not
 * an error and does not need counting: the second ask finds it already held.
