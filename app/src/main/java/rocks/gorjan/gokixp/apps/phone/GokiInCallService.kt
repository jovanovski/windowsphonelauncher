/**
 * The launcher, as the phone.
 *
 * Android will only let one app draw the screen a call is on, and it decides which by the
 * default-phone-app role: whoever holds it gets bound to this service and is handed every
 * call on the device, incoming and outgoing, from this app or any other. There is no
 * halfway - an app cannot answer its own calls and leave the rest to somebody else - so
 * holding the role is the price of having a call screen at all. See [PhoneApp]'s offer to
 * take it, which is the only place it is ever asked for.
 *
 * Almost nothing happens here. The calls go to [CallCentre], which the screen reads; this
 * exists to be bound, to pass things on, and to make sure there is a screen to pass them
 * to - which on a locked phone means a notification with a full-screen intent, because a
 * service is not allowed to start an activity out of the blue and a ringing phone is
 * exactly the case that rule was written to allow.
