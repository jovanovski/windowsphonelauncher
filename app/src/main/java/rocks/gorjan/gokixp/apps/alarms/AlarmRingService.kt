/**
 * The thing that is actually going off.
 *
 * A service rather than an activity, because an alarm has to survive everything that can
 * happen to a screen: the user pressing home, the screen turning itself off, another app
 * being opened over it, the ring screen being killed for memory. The screen
 * ([AlarmRingActivity]) is a view onto this, and stopping the noise is this object's job
 * whether or not anybody is looking at it.
 *
 * **Why it rings on a silent phone.** The sound plays with
 * [android.media.AudioAttributes.USAGE_ALARM] - see [AlarmSounds.attributes] - which puts
 * it on the alarm stream. That stream has its own volume, is not touched by the ringer
 * being switched to silent or to vibrate, and is let through Do Not Disturb by the
 * platform's own default policy. Media volume is a different stream again and has nothing
 * to do with it. So the phone being "on silent" or having the music turned down does not
 * quiet this, and none of that requires forcing a volume or claiming an exemption: the
 * alarm asks to be an alarm and the system's own rules do the rest, which is the only way
 * to do it that stays true when the user changes those rules deliberately.
 *
 * The vibration is not a fallback for that - it rides along with the sound, because a
 * phone face down on a mattress is quieter than its volume setting suggests.
