/**
 * The screen an alarm goes off on.
 *
 * An activity of its own, for the same reason the call screen is one: an alarm arrives
 * when the launcher is not what anybody is looking at, and usually when the phone is
 * locked and face down. Only an activity can be put in front of that - see
 * [setShowWhenLocked] - and this is the shell's answer to the one screen it cannot draw
 * inside its own window.
 *
 * It holds nothing. [AlarmRingService] is what is ringing; this reads it, shows it, and
 * hands snooze and dismiss straight back. If the service stops for any reason - the
 * notification's own buttons, ten minutes going by with nobody answering - this closes
 * itself, because a dismiss screen for an alarm that is no longer going off is a button
 * that does nothing.
