/**
 * Weather, as Windows Phone had it.
 *
 * The Start screen's weather tile shows one reading at a time and a wide one shows three,
 * which is the right amount for a wall and nowhere near enough to decide anything with.
 * This is the same forecast opened out: what it is doing now, what the day is shaped like,
 * what the week is, and the same questions asked about somewhere else.
 *
 * Four sections on one panorama, which is the arrangement the platform used for an app
 * whose parts are all about one subject - the sections here are not different tools, they
 * are the same forecast at four lengths, and burying any of them a level down would be
 * hiding half a forecast behind a tap.
 *
 * Nothing is fetched here. [WeatherStore] holds the phone's one forecast, and the taskbar
 * temperature, the tile, the Quick Glance widget and this app all read it - so opening
 * this cannot produce a second answer that disagrees with the one on Start. What this app
 * adds is the places, the units, and the room to show what was already being fetched.
