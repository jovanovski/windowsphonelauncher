/**
 * The sound a telephone key makes.
 *
 * Two tones at once, one from each of two frequency bands - which is what "touch-tone"
 * means, and why a dialled number is recognisable as a tune. Android generates them for
 * free through [ToneGenerator]; what is worth writing down is when to make one and when
 * not to.
 *
 * The same tone in both places it can be typed. On the keypad it is feedback - the only
 * confirmation that a key registered, since the number at the top of the screen is where
 * the eye is not. In a call it is the same tone the network is being sent, played locally
 * so that pressing 4 for accounts sounds like something happened rather than like nothing
 * did.
 *
 * The generator is a native audio resource, so it is opened on the first key and let go a
 * few seconds after the last one. Neither end of that is worth plumbing through the two
 * keypads by hand: a dial is a burst of presses with long silences either side, and an
 * idle timer describes that exactly.
