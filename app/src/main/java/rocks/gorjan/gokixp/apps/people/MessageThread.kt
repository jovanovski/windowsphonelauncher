/**
 * One conversation: everything said to and from a number, and the box to say more in.
 *
 * Windows Phone drew this as two columns of bubbles - theirs on the left in the chrome's
 * own grey, yours on the right in the accent - and put the text box at the foot with the
 * app bar under it. The bubbles are square, because everything on this platform is.
 *
 * A page rather than a view inside one: it is pushed over People like a profile or a
 * keypad, and is where back goes first. Unlike them it carries no command strip: a
 * conversation has exactly one thing you do to it, and that is say something - which is
 * the box at the foot and the button beside it. Everything else about the person is
 * reached through their name at the top.
 *
 * It watches the message store while it is on screen, so a message arriving lands in the
 * conversation as it is written down - by whichever app on the phone is the one that does
 * the writing. See [MessageStore] for why that is not this one.
