/**
 * Calculator, as Windows Phone 8.1 had it.
 *
 * A field of flat keys under a number, and nothing else: no header, no app bar, no window.
 * Which is the whole design - the calculator was the one app on the phone that was
 * entirely keypad, and the black above it exists to give the answer somewhere to be
 * rather than to hold any chrome.
 *
 * Everything is sized from the width of a single key, which is itself a quarter of the
 * screen less the gaps. The phone's own proportions - a key a fifth again as wide as it is
 * tall, a gap an eighth of a key, a number nearly a key wide - then hold at any screen
 * size, which is what makes this read as the WP8.1 calculator on hardware that is a good
 * deal taller than the phone it was drawn for.
