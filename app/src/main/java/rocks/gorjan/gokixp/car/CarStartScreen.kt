/**
 * Start, on the car screen.
 *
 * The host hands navigation apps a Surface to draw their map on, and this puts a Start
 * screen on it instead. Rather than painting tiles by hand, the Surface is wrapped in a
 * VirtualDisplay and a Presentation is shown on that: the point of the exercise is to run
 * the launcher's own [StartScreenView], and a real window is what gives it a ViewRootImpl,
 * so scrolling, invalidation and the tile animations all work as they do on the phone.
 *
 * Input is the part that does not come free. The host reports gestures rather than
 * touches - there is no long-press at all - so taps are turned back into MotionEvents and
 * posted into the window, and scrolling is applied to the scroller directly, which is far
 * steadier than trying to reconstitute a drag from deltas.
