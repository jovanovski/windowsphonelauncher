/**
 * The three capacitive keys along the bottom of every Windows Phone screen: back, Start,
 * and search.
 *
 * They are fixed, as the hardware's were, and they are the same three everywhere - on
 * Start, in a folder, with a tile held. A key that turns into a different command
 * depending on the page is a key you have to look at before pressing, and these stand in
 * for keys you could find without looking. On Start back has nowhere to go and does
 * nothing, which is what it did on the phone too. Settings is reached by holding Start,
 * along with the shell's other commands, and the task switcher by holding back - both on
 * the key whose tap already means the nearest thing to them.
 *
 * Commands that belong to what the user is doing - recolouring a tile, filling a folder -
 * are not here: they slide up on [WP81SecondaryBar], which is the app bar WP8.1 put above
 * these keys for exactly that.
 *
 * On real hardware these sat below the display; here they are drawn as a bar the shell
 * reserves space for, which is why the floating-window container's bottom margin is
 * re-based onto [HEIGHT_DP] when the WP8.1 shell is active.

     * the shell's tick by the framework; nothing is being claimed here, because nothing
     * framework-side is involved, so the buzz that says the hold has landed has to be
