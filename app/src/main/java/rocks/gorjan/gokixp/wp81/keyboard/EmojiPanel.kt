 * see the note there.
 *
 * Two things shape everything below it:
 *
 *  - **Tapping an emoji must not close this.** The point of a full search-and-browse panel
 *    is to drop several emoji into a message in a row, and a picker that closes itself after
 *    one would turn every second emoji into a fresh tap of the keyboard's own emoji key. So
 *    there is [onBackToLetters] instead - an explicit `abc` - and [onBackspace], because
 *    picking several in a row is exactly when you want to take one back.
 *  - **The grid can be several thousand emoji long**, and [KeyView] - forty views painting
 *    themselves - does not scale to that. So unlike the letter keyboard, which is
 *    [KeyView]s all the way down, only the two keys that do not vary with the data (`abc`,
 *    backspace) are real [KeyView]s here; the search bar is a handful of ordinary widgets,
 *    since there is exactly one of it, and the grid itself is one [View] that lays its own
 *    rows out on a canvas and scrolls them by hand, the way [KeyView] draws a key's own face
 *    rather than being three child views for the same reason.
