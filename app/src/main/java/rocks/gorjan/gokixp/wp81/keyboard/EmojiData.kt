         * the OS image and cannot be updated the way it can from Android 13 on, so an entry
         * from a Unicode release newer than the device would draw as a plain tofu box - a
         * rectangle with a hex code in it - if it were offered at all. [PaintCompat.hasGlyph]
         * is asked once per glyph rather than trusted to some Unicode-version cutoff, because
         * "cannot render" is a fact about *this device's font*, which varies by manufacturer
         * and OS update far more than it varies by the Unicode version the AOSP emoji font
         * happened to ship with.
