/**
 * Where the block of skin-tone variants goes, worked out with no Android in it.
 *
 * Pulled out of the view for the same reason [alternatesBox] is, and it inherits that file's
 * one rule that matters: **the emoji drawn in the grid must be the one under the finger the
 * moment the block opens.** A cell showing a plain yellow wave has to give a plain yellow
 * wave when held and released, or holding becomes a way to pick something at random. That is
 * what [VariantsBox.primary] is for.
 *
 * What is new here, and the reason this is not simply [alternatesBox] with a longer argument
 * list, is the second dimension. An accent row is a row: a key has eight alternates at most
 * and they fit across the keyboard. A family of emoji can have twenty-six - every pairing of
 * five shades for the two people in a handshake, plus the plain one - which is four rows of
 * seven, and rows need an order. They are counted **from the bottom**, so that the first
 * variant is the cell nearest the finger and the block grows upward away from it.
