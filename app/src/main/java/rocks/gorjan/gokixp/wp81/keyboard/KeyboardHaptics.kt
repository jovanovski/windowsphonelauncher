/**
 * How hard a key buzzes, and the one place in the shell allowed to answer that itself.
 *
 * `Haptics` carries an explicit rule and it is a good one: there is a single tick, it goes
 * through [View.performHapticFeedback] rather than the vibrator so it inherits whatever
 * waveform the manufacturer tuned, and it stays silent when the user has turned touch
 * feedback off. Nothing in the shell should be second-guessing any of that.
 *
 * A keyboard is the exception, and narrowly. A tile is tapped a few times a minute and a key
 * is tapped twenty times in ten seconds, which is the rate at which a buzz that is slightly
 * too heavy stops being feedback and becomes the phone shaking in your hand - and slightly
 * too light stops being felt at all. Where that line falls is a property of the phone's motor
 * and of the person holding it, and it is the one haptic in this app somebody has a real
 * reason to want to move. Every keyboard worth using has this control.
 *
 * So it is **additive**: the default is [WP81Settings.WP81_KB_VIBRATION_SYSTEM], which calls
 * straight through to [Haptics] and behaves exactly as the calculator does today, and the
 * vibrator is touched only by somebody who went and asked for it. That override is total -
 * it also overrides the system's touch-feedback switch, which is the point of an override and
 * is why it is not where the setting starts.
 *
 * [strength] is a field rather than a preference read, because these fire on the touch path:
 * the service sets it when the keyboard appears and nothing here goes near `SharedPreferences`
 * with a finger down.
