 * tenth of a key, a key half again as tall as it is wide - then hold at any screen size,
 * which is what lets a layout drawn for a 480-wide phone land correctly on hardware that is
 * a good deal wider and a great deal taller. It is the calculator's grid with two things
 * generalised: the column count is the layout's rather than a constant, because Macedonian
 * needs twelve across where English needs ten, and a key's width is a fraction rather than
 * a whole number, because the phone's enter key is 1.4 keys wide and nothing else will do.
 *
 * The height is *not* a free parameter. An input method is asked how tall it wants to be and
 * is given it, so the grid asks for exactly the height its rows need at the width it has.
