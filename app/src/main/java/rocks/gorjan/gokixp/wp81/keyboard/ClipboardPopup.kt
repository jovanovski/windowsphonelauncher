/**
 * The rest of the clipboard, opened by holding the paste pill.
 *
 * A window rather than a panel, and it opens *downwards* over the keys rather than upwards
 * over the app - which is the opposite of what [AlternatesPopup] does, for the opposite
 * reason. That one shows a row under a finger that is still down, so it has to clear the
 * finger; this one is a list to read and choose from with a second, deliberate tap, and the
 * keyboard is the one rectangle on screen this is entitled to cover. It also means the list
 * can be as tall as the keys without any of the trouble that comes with drawing outside an
 * input method's own window.
 *
 * Deliberately not focusable. A focusable window opened from an input method takes the focus
 * away from the very text field the paste is meant to land in; this one only takes touches,
 * and a touch outside it puts it away.
 *
 * Ordinary views here, unlike the emoji grid and the GIFs, because there are at most twenty
 * rows of it and it is opened by a hold - there is no frame budget to defend on a list that
 * appears once every few minutes.
