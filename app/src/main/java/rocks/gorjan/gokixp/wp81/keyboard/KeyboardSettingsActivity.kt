/**
 * The keyboard's settings, as a page of the phone's own Settings.
 *
 * A whole screen rather than a panel inside the keyboard. The first attempt put these on a
 * page that replaced the keys, reached by holding `&123`, on the reasoning that a setting you
 * notice while typing should be adjustable without leaving what you are typing in. That is
 * true and it was still wrong: Windows Phone's settings were pages - a big lowercase title, a
 * column of rows, the back key to leave - and a settings screen that is a keyboard-shaped
 * rectangle at the bottom of somebody else's app is not that. It also had nowhere to grow, and
 * there will be more of these.
 *
 * So it is an Activity, styled like every other page in the shell, and reached two ways: by
 * holding `&123` on the keyboard, and from Android's own keyboard settings, because it is
 * declared as this input method's `settingsActivity` in `res/xml/method.xml`.
 *
 * Built from the shell's own furniture - [MetroPageHeader], [MetroToggle], [MetroSlider] -
 * rather than new controls or anything from Material, for the same reason as everywhere else:
 * a page that invented its own switch would look like a different application.
