/**
 * The Windows Phone keyboard.
 *
 * The shell goes to real trouble making a text box look like Windows Phone - the caret, the
 * band behind a selection, the three grips either end of it - and then the keyboard that
 * comes up under it is whatever the phone happens to have. This is the other half.
 *
 * It is a keyboard for the whole phone rather than for this app: an input method belongs to
 * the system, so once it is turned on it appears in every text box on the device. That is
 * the point, and it is also why almost everything in here is written defensively. A crash in
 * an ordinary activity loses that activity; a crash in here loses text entry in whatever the
 * user happened to be doing, everywhere, with the way out buried in system settings.
 *
 * The palette is re-read rather than pushed. `WP81Shell.applyPalette` fans a colour change
 * out to the shell's own children, and an input method is in a different window and usually
 * a different task, so it is not among them. Instead the preferences are watched directly,
 * and the palette is read again every time the keyboard is shown - the listener keeps a
 * visible keyboard current, and the re-read covers the case where it was not visible when
 * the change happened.
