/**
 * The skin tones a hold on an emoji opens, in a window of its own.
 *
 * [AlternatesPopup] for emoji, and its own class rather than a second mode of that one
 * because almost nothing is shared beyond the idea: the cells here are emoji rather than
 * characters, they are the size of a grid cell rather than of a key, and there can be
 * twenty-six of them, which is a block rather than a row. What *is* shared is the reason it
 * is a window at all - the block belongs above the cell being held, and above the top row of
 * the grid is outside the input method's window altogether - and the fact that it neither
 * takes focus nor accepts touches: the gesture belongs to the grid, which received the hold
 * and passes the movement along.
