/**
 * The phone's text messages, read and written where every other app on it can see them.
 *
 * The same bargain [PeopleStore] and [PhoneHistory] make: nothing here is this app's own.
 * Messages are read out of the platform's message store and sent through the platform's
 * own [SmsManager], so a conversation held in Messaging is the same conversation the phone's
 * messaging app is showing, and it survives this launcher being uninstalled.
 *
 * SMS only. Multimedia messages and RCS are a different protocol carried by a different
 * provider table, and an app that showed the text half of a picture message would be worse
 * than one that plainly does not do them - see [read], which files drafts and MMS rows
 * away rather than half-rendering them.
 *
 * ### Who writes it down
 *
 * Since Android 4.4 only the phone's *default* messaging app may write to the message
 * store, and this works either way round - which it has to, because holding that role is
 * something the user says yes to rather than something this app assumes.
 *
 *  - **Not the default.** Sending still works: the platform writes a message sent through
 *    [SmsManager] by a non-default app to the store on its behalf. Arriving messages are
 *    written by whichever app *is* the default, and read out of the store here. Nothing
 *    is this app's responsibility, and nothing it does is visible to the rest of the phone
 *    beyond the messages themselves.
 *  - **The default.** Both of those become this app's job and the platform does neither.
 *    An arriving message is delivered to [SmsDeliverReceiver] and has to be written down
 *    and announced by it or it is simply lost; a sent one is written here, before it
 *    leaves, and marked as sent or failed when the network says which. Marking a
 *    conversation read starts working, because that is a write as well.
 *
 * The one thing that does not survive the role is multimedia messages. They arrive as a
 * push that only the default messaging app is handed, and this app cannot fetch one - see
 * [MmsDeliverReceiver], which says so out loud rather than dropping them in silence.
