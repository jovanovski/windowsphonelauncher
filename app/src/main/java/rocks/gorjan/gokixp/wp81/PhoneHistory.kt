 * The provider keeps one row per call. The phone showed one row per *conversation*: three
 * calls to the same person in an afternoon were one line saying so, with the count beside
 * the name. That is the whole of what this does beyond querying - collapse a run of calls
 * to the same number into a single entry, keep the most recent one's time and direction,
 * and count how many were folded in.
 *
 * Runs of them, not totals. Two calls this morning and one last Tuesday are two entries,
 * because the history is a diary and the Tuesday call happened on Tuesday. Only calls that
 * were *next to each other* in the log are folded, which is exactly what the phone did.
