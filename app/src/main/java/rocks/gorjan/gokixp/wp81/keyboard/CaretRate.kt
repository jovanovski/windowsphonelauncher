/**
 * How fast a pushed joystick walks the caret, worked out with no Android in it.
 *
 * Pulled out of [JoystickView] for the same reason [alternatesBox] is pulled out of the popup
 * that uses it. This is the *feel* of the control - what a small push does, what a big one
 * does, what happens the instant it engages - and feel is exactly the kind of thing that comes
 * out slightly wrong and stays wrong, because a caret that runs a bit too fast still looks
 * like a caret running. As plain arithmetic it can be asked questions instead of being tested
 * by holding a thumb on a phone and squinting.
 *
 * It carries state, and the state is the point. A rate is steps per second and a frame is
 * about sixteen milliseconds, so most frames owe the caret a third of a step; rounding each
 * frame's share on its own would floor every one of them to zero and the caret would never
 * move at all. The remainder has to be carried, and where it is *dropped* - on engaging, on
 * returning to the middle, on the caret hitting the end of the text - is what stops a stick
 * paying out movement nobody asked for.
 *
 * It also decides which of the two things a push is asking for, because the stick has two
 * axes and the caret has two ways of moving: along the line a character at a time, and from
 * one line to the next. Nobody pushes exactly sideways, so something has to say that a
 * gesture a few degrees off horizontal is still a horizontal one - see [pick].
