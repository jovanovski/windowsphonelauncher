/**
 * The Windows Phone 8.1 Start screen tile grid.
 *
 * WP8.1 lays tiles out on a fixed four-column grid of small cells. A medium tile is a
 * 2x2 block, a wide tile spans the whole row, and tiles are packed in order into the
 * first rectangle that fits - which is why a small tile will slide up to fill the gap
 * a medium one left beside it, rather than starting a new row.
 *
 * ### Metrics
 * Taken from the WVGA (480x800) reference layout, where a small tile is 99px, medium
 * 210, wide 432x210, the gap 12 and the outer margin 24. Those numbers are internally
 * exact - `2*99 + 12 = 210` and `4*99 + 3*12 = 432`, with `432 + 2*24 = 480` - so they
 * are re-expressed here as fractions of the available width and scale to any screen:
 *
 * ```
 *   outer margin = 5.0%  of width
 *   gap          = 2.5%  of width
 *   small cell   = (width - 2*margin - 3*gap) / 4  ~= 20.6% of width
 * ```
