/**
 * What a keyboard is made of.
 *
 * Kotlin data rather than an XML resource, which is the call the rest of the phone shell
 * makes: there is not a single layout file behind any of it, and a keyboard is the last
 * place to start, because half of what a key needs to say - what it commits as opposed to
 * what it shows, what its hold produces, how wide it is in units of nothing in particular -
 * has no natural spelling in a resource file and would end up as a pile of string arrays
 * that have to be kept in step by hand.
 *
 * The one thing worth knowing before reading further: **nothing here is in pixels or dp.**
 * A key's width is in *units*, where a unit is one plain letter key, and the grid divides
 * whatever width it is given by the layout's column count to find out what a unit is worth
 * today. That is how the same layout lands correctly on a phone, on the outer screen of a
 * folded foldable and on a tablet, and it is the same trick the calculator plays.

     * one of the oldest known problems with typing on glass. A thumb reaching down flattens
     * against the screen, and the touch point Android reports is the centre of that contact
     * patch, which sits *above* where the person believes they are pointing. So the aim is
     * low and the report is high, and the row above catches it.

     * The fix everywhere is the same: the key's hit box stops matching its picture. AOSP's
     * keyboard ships a table of per-row touch corrections measured from user studies; this
     * does the targeted version of the same thing, letting the space bar claim some of the
     * gap and the bottom of the row above without moving anything anybody can see.
