/**
 * One key.
 *
 * Built like the calculator's, with one deliberate difference: the label, the hint and the
 * glyph are painted straight onto the canvas rather than being child views. The calculator
 * has twenty-four keys and can afford a TextView apiece; a keyboard has forty and would want
 * two apiece for the top row, and eighty views that never change and are laid out on every
 * measure pass is a cost with nothing to show for it. Everything else here - the touch
 * target half a gap larger than the painted key, the fill driven off the raw touch stream,
 * the press as one more step along the same colour line - is the calculator's and is
 * deliberately unchanged.
 *
 * The view is *bigger than the key it draws*. The gutters between keys belong to the keys
 * either side of them, split down the middle, so that a finger landing in the gap presses
 * the key it was aimed at rather than nothing at all. Nothing about where keys appear
 * changes; only how far out from each one the touch reaches.
