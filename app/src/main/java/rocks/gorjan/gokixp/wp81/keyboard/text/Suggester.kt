/**
 * What word the user probably meant.
 *
 * **This interface is the seam.** Everything else in the keyboard talks to suggestions through
 * this class and nothing else, which is what makes the engine replaceable: if this
 * hand-written speller turns out to disappoint on genuinely sloppy typing, AOSP's own decoder
 * - Apache 2.0, and far better at this - can be dropped in underneath without the key grid,
 * the candidate bar or the composing logic knowing anything happened. Keep it that way.
 *
 * ## How it works
 *
 * A bounded edit-distance search, walked over the trie rather than over a word list. The
 * insight that makes it fast enough to run on every keystroke: while walking down the trie,
 * carry one row of the Levenshtein matrix per node. That row is the edit distance from the
 * typed text to the prefix spelled by the path so far, at every possible alignment. Because
 * the row can only ever increase as the path lengthens, the moment its smallest entry exceeds
 * the budget, *every word in that entire subtree* is too far away and the branch is abandoned.
 * A single `min` over twenty numbers prunes tens of thousands of words.
 *
 * Three refinements on the textbook version, each earning its keep:
 *
 *  - Substitution is charged by how far apart the keys actually are ([Proximity]), not a flat
 *    rate. This is what separates a keyboard that corrects thumbs from one that corrects
 *    spelling.
 *  - Transposition is a single edit, not two ([Damerau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau-Levenshtein_distance)).
 *    `teh` for `the` is the commonest typo there is and charging it double would bury it.
 *  - The tail of a longer word is nearly free, so completions come out of the same search as
 *    corrections. Typing `hel` finds `hello` without a separate prefix walk, and the small
 *    per-character charge is what makes `help` rank above `helicopter`.
