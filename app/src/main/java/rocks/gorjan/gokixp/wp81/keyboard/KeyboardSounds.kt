/**
 * The click a key makes, and whether it makes one.
 *
 * The companion to [KeyboardHaptics], and deliberately a much smaller thing than it. The
 * vibration setting has a strength because where the line falls between "felt" and "the phone
 * shaking in your hand" is a property of the motor and of the hand holding it. A click has no
 * such problem, so this is a switch and nothing more.
 *
 * **It plays through the media stream rather than through [AudioManager.playSoundEffect].**
 * That is the whole of what is unusual here and it is a deliberate choice with a real cost, so
 * it is worth writing down. `playSoundEffect` is the ordinary way to make this noise and it
 * mixes on the *system* stream, which the ringer profile silences - so a keyboard using it is
 * a keyboard that goes quiet the moment the phone is put on silent, which is exactly what was
 * not wanted. There is no stream that ignores every volume setting, and there should not be;
 * the media stream is the one the ringer profile leaves alone. So the click follows the volume
 * keys - turn media right down and it is silent - and it survives silent mode, which is the
 * distinction being asked for.
 *
 * The sounds themselves are still the platform's own, read off the device rather than shipped:
 * `KeypressStandard.ogg` and its three companions are the files `playSoundEffect` would have
 * played, so a key here clicks like a key everywhere else on the phone - which is the whole of
 * what a keypress sound is for. A device that keeps them somewhere unexpected falls back to
 * `playSoundEffect`, which is quieter and silenceable but is better than nothing.
 *
 * **Off unless asked for.** A vibration is felt by the person holding the phone; a sound is
 * heard by everybody in the room, and one that plays on silent is more so, not less. Windows
 * Phone shipped with a click, and this is the switch that gives it back.
 *
 * [enabled] is a field rather than a preference read, for the same reason [KeyboardHaptics]
 * keeps its strength in one: these fire on the touch path, and nothing here goes near
 * `SharedPreferences` with a finger down.
