/**
 * What a folder tile shows instead of a folder icon: the apps inside it.
 *
 * A folder drawn as a folder says only that it is one. The same tile filled with the
 * icons inside it says what is in it, which is the question actually being asked of a
 * tile on Start - and it is what WP8.1's own Live Folders did.
 *
 * The mini tiles are **always square**, each half the folder tile's shorter side: a 1x1
 * folder previews at 0.5x0.5, a 2x2 at 1x1. How many rows and columns that comes to
 * follows from the folder's own shape - two by two on a square tile, four by two on a wide
 * one, eight by two on a full-width strip, two by four on a tall one - so the squares fill
 * the tile at every size instead of stretching to fit it.
 *
 * Every square carries an app. A folder with more apps than squares used to spend the last
 * one on an ellipsis, which said there was more without saying what: the squares turn over
 * anyway, so the same square spent on another app tells you what the folder holds *and*
 * still gets round to everything in it.
 *
 * The mini tiles are not live, and they carry an app's icon and nothing else. What is
 * unread inside a folder is marked once, on the folder's own name - see
 * TileView.applyFolderLabel - rather than on whichever squares happen to be up: a square
 * turns over every few seconds, so a dot on one is a mark that comes and goes on its own.
 *
 * When there are more apps than squares, one square at a time turns over to another of
 * them, so what is inside reveals itself over a few seconds rather than only on opening.
