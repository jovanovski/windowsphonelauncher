/**
 * The strip above the keys: two glyphs at the near end, suggestions filling the rest.
 *
 * This is the bar in the reference screenshot, and working out what it actually was settled a
 * design question. It looks like chrome - a keyboard-switch and a microphone on the left, a
 * move handle and a close cross on the right, and nothing in between - but that empty middle
 * is where Windows 10 Mobile put its word candidates. The strip *is* the suggestion bar. So
 * suggestions fill it and the glyphs stay at the edge, and the keyboard keeps the height the
 * phone had rather than growing a fifth row to hold predictions.
 *
 * The first suggestion is always the literal text the user typed. That is not a detail either:
 * it is what makes an unwanted autocorrection one tap to reject, so the correction logic can
 * afford to be confident without ever being a trap.
 *
 * **The words are as wide as the words are, and the row scrolls.** It used to be three fixed
 * columns, on the reasoning that a suggestion in a place a thumb can learn is worth more than
 * a fourth-best guess. That was worth trying and it was the wrong trade twice over: three
 * columns of equal width give `a` the same target as `absolutely` and waste most of the bar
 * on the short ones, and three is simply fewer than the dictionary has to say - the fourth
 * word is often the right one and there was nowhere to put it. Sizing each word to its own
 * text fits five or six of the ordinary ones on screen at once, and the rest are a flick away
 * up to [MAX_WORDS]. The phone's own bar scrolled for exactly this reason.
