 * The resolved Windows Phone 8.1 colour scheme.

 *  - an **accent**, one of twenty fixed colours, used for tiles, headers and controls;
 *  - a **background**, either Dark (black) or Light (white), which flips all chrome.
 *
 * Everything is applied programmatically rather than through theme attributes so both
 * can change without recreating the activity.
