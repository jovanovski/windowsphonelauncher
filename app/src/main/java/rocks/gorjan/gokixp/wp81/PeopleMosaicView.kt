/**
 * The People tile: a wall of the faces of the people the user marked, and enough of the
 * rest of the address book to fill it.
 *
 * This is the one Windows Phone tile that was never a reading or a headline. It filled
 * itself edge to edge with contact pictures - nine of them on the square tile, eighteen
 * across the wide one - each under some amount of black, so the wall was a mix of faces
 * caught in the light and faces most of the way into it. Every few seconds one square
 * turned over to somebody else, so a glance at it was a glance at the people rather than
 * at an app called People. Every so often it stopped shuffling and one of them took the
 * whole tile: a face, full bleed, with their name along the bottom, before it turned back
 * to the wall.
 *
 * All three are here. The squares turn one at a time, round-robin over the grid and over
 * whoever was handed over - favourites first, so they are the faces the wall opens on, and
 * the few behind them are what a square has to turn over to; each turn draws
 * its square a fresh depth of black - see [shade]; and after a few of those the whole
 * mosaic turns over onto one person and back again. No names anywhere: the tile is named
 * for the program it opens, whichever face of whichever contact it happens to be showing,
 * and a wall of faces that renamed itself every few seconds was a tile nobody could find
 * twice.
 *
 * Drawn rather than assembled out of child views, unlike the folder preview it otherwise
 * resembles. Everything on it is a rectangle of a picture: the squares, the flip that
 * turns one of them over, and the same flip applied to the whole tile for the takeover.
 * One canvas doing all three keeps the takeover from having to rearrange a grid of views
 * mid-animation.
 *
 * The pictures come from [ContactFeed], which holds them for every tile at once and
 * decides who is on the wall in the first place. What is *not* held here is the address
 * book itself: the host reads that, because it is the host that has to ask for the
 * permission first. See MainActivity.refreshWP81People.
