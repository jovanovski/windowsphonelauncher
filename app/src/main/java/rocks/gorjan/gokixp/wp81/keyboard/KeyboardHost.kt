/**
 * Everything the input method puts on screen, in the three arrangements it has.
 *
 * A vertical stack of three things - a panel, the suggestion bar, and the keys - of which any
 * combination can be showing:
 *
 *  - **Typing.** Bar and keys. The ordinary keyboard.
 *  - **Emoji.** The panel alone, at the full height, with the keys and the bar out of the way.
 *  - **Searching emoji.** The panel *and* the keys, with the bar hidden. This is the one the
 *    arrangement exists for. An input method cannot type into a text field of its own, so a
 *    search box inside a panel that has replaced the keyboard is a box with no way to put
 *    anything in it - it looked like a search bar and did nothing when tapped. The keys have
 *    to come back underneath, and the panel has to shrink to make room for them.
 *
 * Visibility rather than adding and removing views: the panel holds three and a half thousand
 * emoji and a scroll position, and rebuilding that on every press of the comma key would be a
 * stutter every time.
