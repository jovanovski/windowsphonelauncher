/**
 * The user's own recent pictures and videos, for the Photos tile.
 *
 * WP8.1's Photos tile was a slideshow of the camera roll, and it is the one live tile
 * whose content the phone already has: no feed to fetch, no key to hold, nothing to keep
 * current beyond asking MediaStore what is new.
 *
 * The camera roll, and nothing else. MediaStore's idea of an image is every picture on the
 * phone - saved memes, WhatsApp forwards, app artwork, screenshots of a bank balance - and
 * a tile turning through those on a home screen is not a slideshow of anything, it is a
 * leak. Only what the camera wrote is looked at.
 *
 * Video as well as stills, interleaved by when they were taken: what a phone camera
 * records is part of the same roll, and a tile that skipped every clip would be showing a
 * gappy version of a day out. A clip is handed back marked as one, so the tile can play it
 * where its first frame would otherwise sit.
 *
 * Only the most recent handful are offered. A tile turns over every few seconds and shows
 * one picture at a time, so the whole library would be a queue nobody ever reaches the end
 * of - where the last twenty are the ones the user would recognise, which is what makes a
 * glance at the tile worth anything.
 *
 * Decoded small: stills through [ImageDecoder], which applies the EXIF rotation a camera
 * writes - read with the raw decoder, a portrait photograph arrives on its side - and
 * clips through MediaStore's own thumbnailer, which is the only thing that will produce a
 * frame at all. The frame is what the tile shows while the clip is opening, and what it
 * falls back to if it cannot be played.
