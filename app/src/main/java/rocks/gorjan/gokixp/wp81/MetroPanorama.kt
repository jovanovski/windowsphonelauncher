/**
 * The Windows Phone panorama: a row of section titles over a set of pages, dragged
 * sideways as one long surface.
 *
 * Shell furniture rather than any one program's: Zune is laid out on it and so is News,
 * and anything else here with more sections than a screen would be too.
 *
 * Two things make it a panorama rather than a set of tabs. The titles are laid out end to
 * end and move *with* the drag, so the next section's name is already on screen, half
 * arrived, before you get to it - the app is wider than the phone and says so. And the
 * gesture is the whole screen, not a strip at the top: you push the page itself.
 *
 * There are three layers, and the whole effect is that they move at different rates. The
 * pages travel with the finger. The section titles travel with them, so each name arrives
 * at the left margin exactly as its page does - the header strip is a continuous line of
 * words rather than a set of tabs. The app's own name, at the top, travels slowest of all:
 * it drifts a fraction of the screen over the entire panorama, which is what tells the eye
 * that the app is one wide surface being moved across rather than a stack of screens being
 * swapped. Microsoft's own guidance for the control puts it exactly that way - the title's
 * rate of motion is slow relative to the content, and slower again than the background art.
 *
 * It is a loop: pushing past the last section brings the first one round again, which is
 * what the platform did and what makes a panorama a surface rather than a queue. What it
 * does *not* do is lay its names out twice to get there - see [rebuildStrip] for how the
 * strip crosses the seam with only one of each name on it.
