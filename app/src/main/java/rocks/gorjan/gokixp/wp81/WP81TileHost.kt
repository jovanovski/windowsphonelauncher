/**
 * What goes on a Start screen, and how each tile is painted.
 *
 * This used to sit in MainActivity, which was fine while the phone was the only thing
 * showing tiles. The car screen shows the same wall on a second display, and the one
 * thing it must not do is keep its own idea of what is pinned and what colour it is -
 * a tile added or recoloured on the phone has to be on the car screen too, without
 * anyone remembering to add it twice.
 *
 * So the wall's *contents* live here, reachable from anywhere with a Context, while what
 * a tap does about them stays with the caller: opening a window is the launcher's job on
 * the phone, and on the car screen most tiles have nowhere to open at all.
 *
 * The seams are the things only the launcher can answer - its live icon list, whether a
 * rename is in force, and which way up the arrangement is being read. A read-only surface
 * such as the car passes no writers, so nothing it does can disturb the phone's wall.
