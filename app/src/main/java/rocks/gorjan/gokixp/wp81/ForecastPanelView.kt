/**
 * The weather tile's forecast, laid out across the tile instead of turned through it.
 *
 * A tile with one cell to its name can only show one reading at a time, so it shows them
 * in turn: now, today's high, tomorrow's. Give it two cells and turning them over stops
 * being economy and starts being a delay - the tile has the room to say all of it at once,
 * and a glance at a wide tile should not have to be timed to catch the day it wanted.
 *
 * So each reading gets a column of its own - what it is of, what the sky is doing, and the
 * figure - and the tile stops rotating for as long as it is wide enough to hold them. Which
 * readings there are is not this view's business: it draws the columns it is handed, two of
 * them or three, and the host drops today's once the day's high is behind us.
 *
 * Drawn rather than laid out in child views. Three bands of different kinds of thing, sized
 * against each other and against the tile they are in, are easier to keep on one baseline
 * with a canvas than with a row of nested layouts - and the tile is already full of those.
