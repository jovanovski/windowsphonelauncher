/**
 * The field of GIFs that takes the emoji grid's place.
 *
 * A separate view rather than a mode of `EmojiPanel.GridView`, because almost nothing is
 * shared: emoji are text drawn in equal square cells and these are files fetched over the
 * network, of every shape there is, each one a running animation. What *is* shared - drawn
 * by hand on one canvas, scrolled and flung by hand - is shared because the reason holds
 * here too: a real view per cell, in an input method's window, on the path where a tap has
 * to be answered inside a frame.
 *
 * Laid out in columns of equal width and unequal length, each GIF placed in whichever column
 * is currently shortest. A GIF is as wide as it is and as tall as it is; forcing them into
 * squares crops the caption off half of them, which is usually the part that made the GIF
 * worth sending.
