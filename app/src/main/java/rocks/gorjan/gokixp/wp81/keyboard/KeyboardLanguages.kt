/**
 * Which languages the keyboard offers, and telling Android about it.
 *
 * Two separate things have to agree and neither is derivable from the other. The setting is
 * what the user chose. Android's *enabled subtypes* are what the system will let the globe in
 * the navigation bar cycle through - and by default it decides that for itself, enabling only
 * the subtypes that match the phone's own languages. So a Macedonian layout on an English
 * phone is declared, registered, and never offered: holding the globe shows English alone.
 *
 * [applyToSystem] is the bridge. It is the only way a keyboard can have a language list of its
 * own that the rest of the system honours.
