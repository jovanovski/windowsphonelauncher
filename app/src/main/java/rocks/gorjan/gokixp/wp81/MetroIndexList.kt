/**
 * The Windows Phone 8.1 alphabetical list.
 *
 * The app list is the famous one - swipe left from Start and there it is - but the phone
 * used the same page in half a dozen places, the People hub among them, and it was the
 * same page every time: rows filed under outlined letter squares, a square tapped to open
 * the jump grid, a held letter at the top saying where the list has got to, and a search
 * band that takes the rail's place when it is asked for. Two copies of that would be two
 * lists that drift apart, so there is one of it and the things that genuinely differ are
 * named below.
 *
 * What a subclass says is what its rows are: [letterOf] to file one, [matches] to search
 * one, and a holder to draw one. What it may say is how big the squares are, whether the
 * band carries a search ring of its own, and how far in from the left the rows begin.
 * Everything else - the folding of the letters into a search and back out, the rail that
 * slides away with the ring, the held square being pushed off by the next one coming up -
 * is the platform's behaviour rather than any one list's, and belongs here.
