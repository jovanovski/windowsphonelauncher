/**
 * The address book, as something you can change.
 *
 * [ContactFeed] reads it for the People tile and stops there: a wall of faces only ever
 * needs a name, a picture and whether somebody is starred. The People app is the other
 * half of the same thing - it opens a person up, and it writes back. So the reading here
 * goes deeper (numbers, addresses, which account a contact came from) and there is a
 * writing side at all.
 *
 * Kept apart from the app that uses it for the reason every provider wrapper is: the
 * queries and the batches are about Android's contacts provider, and the app is about
 * Windows Phone. Mixing the two would put `ContentProviderOperation` in the middle of a
 * panorama.
 *
 * Everything that touches the provider runs off the main thread, and every callback comes
 * back on it. A phone with four thousand contacts on it is a real phone, and the address
 * book is on disk.

     * than as an abbreviation, and "Gorjan" is as entitled to a pair as "Gorjan Jovanovski".

     * telephone number - a message or a call from somebody the book does not know - and
     * "+3" is not anybody's initials. The square is left as the bare accent there, which
     * is the honest answer to a person with neither a picture nor a name.
     *
     * The one rule for the whole shell: the contact list, the favourites wall, the
     * conversations, the call screen and the Start tile all abbreviate a name through here,
     * so nobody is two different pairs of letters depending on where they are being shown.
