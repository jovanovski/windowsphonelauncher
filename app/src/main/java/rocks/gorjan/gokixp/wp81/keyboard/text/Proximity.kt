/**
 * How near two keys are to each other, as a substitution cost.
 *
 * The single change that makes autocorrect feel like it understands a thumb rather than a
 * dictionary. Typing `s` where `a` was meant is a finger that landed a few millimetres left;
 * typing `p` where `a` was meant is a different word. A speller that charges the same for both
 * has to be told, by the frequency table alone, which of `sad` and `pad` you meant - and it
 * will get it wrong about half the time, because both are ordinary words.
 *
 * Built from the layout's own geometry, so it is correct for whichever keyboard is up: the
 * neighbours of `а` on the Macedonian layout are nothing like the neighbours of `a`, and
 * nothing here needs to know that.
 *
 * Distances are in key widths, which is what [KeyboardLayout.keyCentres] reports, so the
 * thresholds below mean what they say regardless of screen size: 1.0 is the next key along.
 *
 * ## Asked in two halves, and why
 *
 * This is the innermost thing in the keyboard. The edit-distance walk asks it once for every
 * position in the typed word against every edge it considers, which is hundreds of thousands
 * of times per keystroke - so the answer has to cost about as little as an array read, and
 * the lookup that finds a character's place in the table must not happen inside that loop.
 *
 * Hence [slotOf] and [cost] rather than one call taking two characters. A character's slot is
 * found once - once per keystroke for the typed text, once per trie edge for the candidate -
 * and the loop itself is then two array reads. It was a `HashMap<Char, Int>` consulted twice
 * per comparison, which is a hash, a boxed `Character` and a boxed `Int` in the hottest loop
 * in the app.
