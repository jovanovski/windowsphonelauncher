/**
 * The caret joystick: a dot in the gutter that drags the cursor.
 *
 * Putting the caret where you want it on a phone is genuinely hard - the target is a gap
 * between two letters, under a fingertip that covers eight of them - and there are two answers
 * to it. One is the space bar, which this keyboard already has: drag the widest key on the
 * board and the caret follows. The other is this, and the difference between them is not the
 * gesture but what it costs.
 *
 * The space bar's version is free in screen but not in confidence. Every space typed is a
 * gesture that *might* have been a slide, so the slop that tells them apart has to be
 * generous, and a thumb that rolls sideways off the key still occasionally moves the caret
 * when it meant to type a space. A control that does nothing else has no such problem: there
 * is nothing to disambiguate it from, so it answers the first pixel of movement and it answers
 * every time. That is why turning this on turns the space bar's slide *off* rather than
 * leaving both - two ways to do one thing is not twice as good, it is one of them still
 * costing you the occasional wrong space for a gesture you no longer use.
 *
 * It is also why it moves in four directions where the space bar could only ever move in two.
 * A key can only report the one axis it is not already using; a control of its own can report
 * both, so up and down are here as well, and they do what up and down have always done to a
 * caret - the line above, the line below, at the column it was already in. Not that the two
 * are the same gesture at right angles: characters and lines are wildly different sizes, so
 * they run at wildly different rates and only one of them can be asked for at a time. See
 * [CaretRate].
 *
 * It sits on the crossing of two gutters - the one above the bottom row, and the one after
 * that row's first key - because that is the one place on a full keyboard where nothing is,
 * and where a thumb resting between rows is already close to it.
 *
 * The halo is the part that makes it work. A dot painted *on* the keys would be a mark on a
 * key, which reads as decoration; a dot with a ring of bare keyboard around it has visibly had
 * room made for it, and that ring is also the promise about where the touch target is.
