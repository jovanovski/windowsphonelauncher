/**
 * The letter that appears above a key while it is held down.
 *
 * A thumb covers the key it is pressing, so on a phone the one thing you cannot see while
 * typing is what you have just typed. Every keyboard's answer is the same and has been since
 * the first one: lift the character clear of the finger for as long as the finger is there.
 * Windows Phone lit the key itself in the accent, which is a good answer on a keyboard held
 * in two hands and a thin one under a thumb - so the key still lights, and this is the part
 * somebody can switch on when that is not enough.
 *
 * It has to be its own window, for the same reason the alternates row does: the flag belongs
 * *above* the key, and above the top row is off the top of the input method's window
 * entirely. Painting it into the keyboard would work for three rows out of four and be
 * clipped away for the fourth. A [PopupWindow] with [PopupWindow.setClippingEnabled] turned
 * off is the way out, and is what AOSP's own keyboard does with its key previews.
 *
 * Painted the accent, like the key it came off: a flag in one colour above a key in another
 * would read as two things happening rather than as one key saying what it is. That also puts
 * it in step with [AlternatesPopup], whose chosen cell is the accent for the same reason -
 * those are the only two things on this keyboard that float above it, and two floating
 * surfaces that behaved differently would read as two different mechanisms.
 *
 * **The window is kept up between keystrokes.** Dismissing on release and showing again on
 * the next press is a window torn down and built twenty times in ten seconds, which is
 * exactly the wrong work to be doing on the touch path; instead the flag is moved with
 * [PopupWindow.update] while typing continues, and a short delay after the last key comes up
 * puts it away. That delay is also what stops the flag flickering between two letters typed a
 * few milliseconds apart.
